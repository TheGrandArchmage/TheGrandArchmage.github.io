My name is **Silvio Pilato**. 
I am a developer based in the deep south of Italy.

My passion lies on pretty much everything you can transform, create and/or _destroy_(MUHAHAHAHAHAH).

I am the king of _nasty_ and _stupid_ jokes, trying to make a living out of creating videogames, and meanwhile I pursue development in other areas of interest.
