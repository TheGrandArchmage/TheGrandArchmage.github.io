Maybe you just came on this blog, looking for some technical devlog-ish stuff on "how to make a better game" or "how to make X in my Y game engine".
There will be a day for that stuff. Well, this blog will be more on the technical side that on the emotional one, so actually where will be _a lot of days for that stuff_.
These days I wondered about what could be the first issue I could discuss about, what question I could tackle first.

Since I choose the **development way** I stumbled on that particular question: "What do I need to learn right now?".
Computer science is a broad field, with lots of routes and a hellish number of intersections between each area of interest.
With so many notion and things to do. **You never know enough.**
So you have to learn something everyday, better if in an efficient way.
And game development especially has that particular aspect where everything will absolutely work, _until you actually try it_.

So that's where game jams come in help for me and why I think they are such a powerful tool for everyone that wants to work in the game development industry: they force you to try stuff in a meaningful way, so you start seeing the stuff _you think_ you know and, more importantly, enlightening what you don't know.

Enough with that intro.
Let me show you, from my humble personal experience, some tips to make your experience better during your first game jams.

### Start already

What? Why are you even here?
Well, ok, maybe read through that post but then, _absolutely_, **start looking for your first game jam**. Or maybe your second or your third, I don't know.
You think that your project will fail and perish in less than a second because you have no idea and bla-bla.
But remember that failing is part of any learning path and, as I said before, we are here to learn.

So, start failing right now!

### Visualize your project

Maybe I did convince you, you just joined a jam and right now you are staring at your screen which in return is almost empty, showing you your desktop theme.
Generally every game jam comes with a theme, if not you may try brainstorming some ideas.
Don't be scared, pick any of your ideas that seems "doable" and start thinking about it.

Write your idea down. Draw it if necessary. You will start thinking: "How do I do stuff X?"
Well, do your research or try to come up with your solution, just try to plan something and **visualize it using a piece of paper or a blank piece of electronic sheet**.

It doesn't matter if your plans will prove faulty during your execution.
At least you started actively thinking about your project and you may even have a sketch of it that will prove helpful while coding or designing.

### Simplicity

During your mind wandering you may feel tempted to add more and more features.
If you think they may prove valid, fantastic! Write them down do you may remember them in the future.
Just remember to keep your project as simple as possible.
During every game jam time is the enemy and there is no worse sensation that having a major bug in your core game mechanic, because you just lost 2 days trying to make
your menu buttons shine.

Always, always, always: **Core First, Features Second**.

That may not be the most valid motto in the industry but it will be fundamental for you.
You should be _hunting_ your first core game mechanic prototype since the start.
A solid core game mechanic will always make a game.
An ensemble of fantastic features alone will only make up for a pile of...something.

### Rest!

Maybe you just passed the last 12 hours following my advices and working hard.
What now? Now go get some rest.
Resting is as important as working: you may want to get into a 16 hour working marathon. But you know what? Your rush will burn you out quickly, leaving behind only a tired human being, filled by a daunting sense of guilt.
**Your brain matters**. As a programmer your brain is your most important tool.
Go get some rest, take a pause now and then and you will see improvement in your productive process.
_I promise_.

### Use your strengths but get out of your comfort zone
You may find yourself striving for challenges.
That may way get you to enter topics of the art of game development which are unknown to you, or maybe you just will begin messing around with new tools.
It's ok to explore and I find fundamental to get out of your comfort zone from time to time. **Just do not overdo it**.
Maybe it's the case to experiment on a IA algorithm completely new to you, just don't do it while you are testing a new engine and scripting in a new language.
Take your time and do one step at time, or your entire game jam experience may get ruined by frustration. And you will probably not learn too much, getting overwhelmed by concepts.

### Be patient

Your first game jams may fail. You may get into trouble debugging or you may just find yourself into any external unforeseen event that may compromise your project. Be patient.
Rome wasn't built in a day and we all can agree how wonderful Rome is, right?



And, at last one of the most important advice I can give: **cooperate**.
Maybe you are a one army man of skills, coding, designing and making sounds & arts like a ninja, but working along with teammates will give you some of the most important lessons you will ever learn.
